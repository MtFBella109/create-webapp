# create-webapp


## State of create-webapp
Right now it's considered as a Alpha, I rewrote the complete Code in a other Programming Language,  one Feature is only left to re-implement. 
The Program is right now very basic, you can create a WebApp and it can create for you a .desktop entry for this WebApp thats it for the Moment.
Right now, it only works under Linux, in the future there will be support for *BSD, MacOS and maybe Windows

##Instalation
1. Download the .rar under releases
2. Extract everything in a Place where you like
3. install nodejs
4. install nativefier with `npm -g install nativefier`
5. Go into the directory, where the files are in your Terminal
6. Run `./create-webapp` in your Terminal




### Note for upcoming version
The next Version will take a bit, my Plan is to move on to a other Programming Language and that needs Time.
I need to learn the new programming Language and then rewrite the Code, but the first thing will take longer I guess

First Release of the new Version should be this week
