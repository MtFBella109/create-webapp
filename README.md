# create-webapp


## State of create-webapp
Right now it's considered as a Alpha, I rewrote the complete Code in a other Programming Language,  one Feature is only left to re-implement. 
The Program is right now very basic, you can create a WebApp and it can create for you a .desktop entry for this WebApp thats it for the Moment.
Right now, it only works under Linux, in the future there will be support for *BSD, MacOS and maybe Windows

## Development break
I can't really develop this program at the Moment
Because I have to much going on in my Life.
Maybe there are coming one or two small updates, but maybe not.
The development break is till next year, idk which month exactly next Year

4. install nativefier with `npm -g install nativefier`

## Reimplemention of already existed Features
