# create-webapp
This is a simple python Script, that let's you create WebApp's at the Moment only via terminal and at the Moment you can only create WebApp's with that
If you want to run the Script you need pip, python3 and nativefier. You can install nativefier through npm, with the command: npm install -g nativefier
The following pip packages are needed: "wget, toml, tomli"

The Scripts works only on Linux, maybe it can work on unix, bsd or MacOs. If you want the Script to generate a systemwide desktop entry, you need to have sudo.
If you want to run the Script systemwide create a symlink in /usr/bin 

It is very basic at the Moment, but I will improve it in the Future. You can contribute to the Code or can create a new locale for your Language
